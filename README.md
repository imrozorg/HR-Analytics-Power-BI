üìä HR Analytics Dashboard Project: Unveiling Employee Attrition Reasons
In my latest Power BI project, I delved into HR analytics to uncover the underlying reasons behind employee attrition. Leveraging data sourced from GitHub, I embarked on a journey to identify key insights that shed light on this critical aspect of workforce management.

üîç Process Overview:

Data Collection: Accessed and gathered relevant datasets from GitHub to kickstart the analysis.
Defining the Question: Formulated crucial questions to guide the investigation, focusing primarily on understanding the drivers of employee turnover.
Data Cleaning: Employed rigorous data cleaning techniques to ensure data accuracy and reliability, laying a robust foundation for analysis.
KPI Creation: Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) tailored to assess various factors contributing to attrition, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the issue.
Through this project, I utilized my expertise in data analysis and visualization to generate actionable insights for organizational decision-making. I'm excited to share the learnings and implications of this project and explore how they can be applied to enhance employee retention strategies in diverse workplace environments.
