üìä Employee Attrition Analysis Project: Understanding Why Employees Leave

In my recent project using Power BI, I looked into why employees leave their jobs. I used data from GitHub and asked important questions to figure out what causes employees to quit.

üîç How I Did It:

1.Getting Data: I collected relevant information from GitHub to start my investigation.
2.Asking Questions: I thought about important questions to guide my research, focusing on what makes employees leave their jobs.
3.Cleaning Data: I made sure the data I was using was accurate and reliable by cleaning it up.
4.Creating Key Metrics: I made special measurements called key performance indicators (KPIs) to help me understand why employees leave. I used what I learned from my US CMA studies to do this.
With this project, I used my skills in data analysis and visualization to find helpful information for companies. I'm excited to share what I learned and discuss how it can help companies keep their employees happy.
